Shared Free Moments is an innovative smart calendar app designed to cater to the scheduling needs of diverse groups, including families, friends, couples and teams. 

The vision is to make it easer to find a common free time of a team

Differences between similar applications 
Support multi-user data interaction synchronously, support the creation of group events 
Most of the multiplayer calendar apps on the market simply merge each member's personal calendar together, so everyone can know what everyone else is doing at what time, which undoubtedly lacks user privacy. However, we don't care about the individual schedule and time of each member, and our application is more focused on the free time of each member
My app allows users to enter the time period they expect group events to be held and the specific personal date period they do not want to occupy, which can better screen the appropriate time for users to hold group events and protect users' privacy
The app also provides a voting function, which provides democracy, convenience and fairness for holding group events, eliminating the need for additional discussion among app users to confirm the final event in the past applications
