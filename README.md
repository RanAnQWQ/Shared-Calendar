#Shared-Calendar
Android project work completed independently, based on an open source project improvement (https://gitee.com/cnctema/EaseCalendar-Weekly-view.git)
***
Shared Free Moments is an innovative smart calendar app designed to cater to the scheduling needs of diverse groups, including families, friends, couples and teams. 
***
The vision is to make it easer to find a common free time of a team
***
##Differences between similar applications 
Support multi-user data interaction synchronously, support the creation of group events
***
Most of the multiplayer calendar apps on the market simply merge each member's personal calendar together, so everyone can know what everyone else is doing at what time, which undoubtedly lacks user privacy. However, we don't care about the individual schedule and time of each member, and our application is more focused on the free time of each member
My app allows users to enter the time period they expect group events to be held and the specific personal date period they do not want to occupy, which can better screen the appropriate time for users to hold group events and protect users' privacy
***
The app also provides a voting function, which provides democracy, convenience and fairness for holding group events, eliminating the need for additional discussion among app users to confirm the final event in the past applications

####new ideas:
1.Calculating mutual time & show in Colorful visual blocks
Using apps above, finding a common time for a friend gathering often involves everyone checking or comparing their schedules, which can be cumbersome
However, our app can calculate the free time of group event for you, and show in colored blocks, easy to use and check

2.Add your personal expected or private time for group events
In addition to considering each participant‘s personal schedule, we will also consider:
each participant’s expected time period for this event, and update the free time slots 

Specific dates and time periods that the user does not want to occupy

Users can select multiple preferred time slots

Each participant time slots will be considered equally

***
3.Voting for multiple times available
After all users have selected their preferred time slots, we will combine each participant‘s schedule with the desired time period and then give the recommended time list

The status of group event will turn to ONGOING, which means we can start to vote
putting suggested times to a vote among participants before finalizing the event also adds a democratic approach to scheduling
Each participant can choose multiple time slots, the application will calculate the time slots with most votes and determine the final group event time

4.Add group event to your personal schedule automatically
After voting, the status of group event will turn to COMPLETED, and will automatically add into the personal schedule of every participant
